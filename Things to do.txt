untested:
make speical attack damage enemy 

most important:
bt needs to attack more maybe 
slide when attacking 
make collision event for special attack more dramatic like a particle effect on collision to signify its actually hit. 
hit animation for main enemy 
when player collides while moving run animaiton stops 
mini enemy fuzzy 
player anim rep attack issue 

not working:

stretch goals:
death animation 
maybe a way to pick attacks based on TP? (decision tree)
make more attacks
sfx
comment code 
lock movement sometimes lasts too long tbh (TIME LIMIT ON IT AND WAIT MODE?)
attack needs delaying until x seconds into aniamtion (half of freeze time) call attack anim when wait start instead maybe?
area avoid for mini enemies 





















done: 
mini enemy no longer crashes it - problem was that attack was making it loop
changed speical attack from obstcle so no teleporting 
flee tim elimit 
mini enemy no longer makes player float 
player cnat get trapped anymore (MINI ENEMY IS trigger now)
