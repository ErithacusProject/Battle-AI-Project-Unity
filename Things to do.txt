untested:
last minute stats 
check how offensively the player is playing 

needs coding:
Attack aniamtion
fast and slow run (depending on speed)
work on finite state machine enemy
work on finite state machine animation 
change time limit for wait mode (make it serialze field?)
player only regain TP when attack actually hits
maybe a way to pick attacks based on TP?
very slow moving down when Y isnt locked, because fallins it getting set to first frame speed instead of getting faster. need to read current veloctiy and mke changes to that without changing Y
fix overhead UI for enemy

done: 
issue: on attacked not calling any fucntions below  (lower attack cooldown or have different ones for range and mellee?)
hp and tp UI (player)
