untested:
last minute stats 
check how offensively the player is playing 

needs coding:
Attack aniamtion
fast and slow run (depending on speed)
work on finite state machine enemy
work on finite state machine animation 
change time limit for wait mode (make it serialze field?)
player only regain TP when attack actually hits
maybe a way to pick attacks based on TP?
fix overhead UI for enemy

tomorrow:
animation and behaviour tree adjusting 

done: 
issue: on attacked not calling any fucntions below  (lower attack cooldown or have different ones for range and mellee?)
hp and tp UI (player)
very slow moving down when moving on jump
ui anchoring
