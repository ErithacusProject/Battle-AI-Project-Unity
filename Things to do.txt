untested:
make speical attack damage enemy 

most important:
bt needs to attack more maybe 
the mini enmeys like no tbeing attacked too  much
i fyou special attack when in collision of enemy it will push you back 
mian enemy doesnt di ehwne under 0 hp when it is in a navigateion behaviour 
slide when attacking 
special attack stoppin at enemy looks fucked 
hit animation for main enemy 
flee tim elimit 
when player colllides while moving run animaiton stops 
can take damage in free but is not checked 
abort seeking behaviours
mini enemy lifts player into air  
mini enemy fuzzy 

not working:

stretch goals:
death animation 
maybe a way to pick attacks based on TP? (decision tree)
make more attacks
sfx
comment code 
lock movement sometimes lasts too long tbh (TIME LIMIT ON IT AND WAIT MODE?)
attack needs delaying until x seconds into aniamtion (half of freeze time) call attack anim when wait start instead maybe?
area avoid for mini enemies 





















done: 
mini enemy no longer crashes it - problem was that attack was making it loop
