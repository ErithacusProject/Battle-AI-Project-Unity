untested:
fsm stay in idle for longer before wander 
bt wait modew still going over max time issue: subtracting deltatime may not work as intended
fsm make area where in player range bigger so they seek more 

needs coding:
death animation 
maybe a way to pick attacks based on TP? (decision tree)
make more attacks
lock movement sometimes lasts too long tbh (TIME LIMIT ON IT AND WAIT MODE?)
sfx
comment code 
main ai still moving when min enemies are trigger 
player special not working afterr 2 still taking tp needs longer cooldown
nav to attack still causing issues 
mini enemy not seeking player when in range 

not working:
when mini enemies spawn main enemy teleports (ignore collision layer needs adding)

done:
