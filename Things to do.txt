untested:
make speical attack damage enemy 
flee time limit 

most important:
bt needs to attack more maybe 
slide when attacking (player)
hit animation for main enemy 
when player colllides while moving run animaiton stops on enemy
mini enemy lifts player into air 
delay in starting behaviour based on intelligence value

not working:

stretch goals:
death animation 
maybe a way to pick attacks based on TP? (decision tree)
make more attacks
sfx
comment code 
lock movement sometimes lasts too long tbh (TIME LIMIT ON IT AND WAIT MODE?)
attack needs delaying until x seconds into aniamtion (half of freeze time) call attack anim when wait start instead maybe?
area avoid for mini enemies 





















done: 
mini enemy no longer crashes it - problem was that attack was making it loop
mian enemy doesnt di ehwne under 0 hp when it is in a navigateion behaviour 
if you special attack when in collision of enemy it will teleort enemy and stop attack
