untested:
fsm stay in idle for longer before wander 
bt wait modew still going over max time issue: subtracting deltatime may not work as intended
fsm make area where in player range bigger so they seek more 
ui number round for hp so it doesnt decimalise

needs coding:
Attack aniamtion
death animation 
maybe a way to pick attacks based on TP? (decision tree)
make more attacks
player attack animation cooldown
lock movement sometimes lasts too long tbh (TIME LIMIT ON IT AND WAIT MODE?)
fix the too fast rotataion with toms fix
wait time after attakcs too long (or wait mode being called too often?) maybe add a cooldown to it 
sfx
mini enemy needs attack cooldown maybe
comment code 
mini enemy anim script says navmesh agent and aniamtor are null.

not working:
when mini enemies spawn main enemy teleports (ignore collision layer needs adding)

done: 
naviagte to attack still not working sometimes??
