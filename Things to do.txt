untested:
last minute stats 
condition: is health high?
condition: is health low?


needs coding:
Attack aniamtion
fast and slow run (depending on speed)
make new conditions based on AI strategy questionaire 
apply things in the questionaire to behaviour tree and change chances 
work on finite state machine enemy
work on finite state machine animation 
change time limit for wait mode (make it serialze field?)
hp and tp UI (player and AI)
player only regain TP when attack actually hits
sapwn helpers function 
check how offensively the player is playing 
maybe a way to pick attacks based on TP?


done: 
response to being attacked
child rotation issue 
fix pathfinding for range attacks
make it so range attacks can lose tp
make a check distance node 

check if youve been attacked 
check if colliding 
or not colliding 
then check health 

after attack 
check how ffensively playing is 
if very then special attack 
if not then range 
flee if hp low first 
if not low then mellee
