untested:
make speical attack damage enemy 

most important:
bt needs to attack more maybe 
the mini enmeys like no tbeing attacked too  much
i fyou special attack when in collision of enemy it will push you back 
mian enemy doesnt di ehwne under 0 hp 
slide when attacking 
special attack stoppin at enemy looks fucked 
hit animation for main enemy 
flee tim elimit 
when player colllides while moving run animaiton stops 
can take damage in free but is not checked 
abort seeking behaviours 

not working:

stretch goals:
death animation 
maybe a way to pick attacks based on TP? (decision tree)
make more attacks
sfx
comment code 
lock movement sometimes lasts too long tbh (TIME LIMIT ON IT AND WAIT MODE?)
attack needs delaying until x seconds into aniamtion (half of freeze time) call attack anim when wait start instead maybe?
area avoid for mini enemies 





















done: 
change how player vicinity and vicinity from enemy works to make it fuzzy 
fix anim again 
nav to attack fix again and ad on enter function 
floating main enemy
freeze times need adjusting 
not looking at player sometimes while doing attack anim
main enemy moving while doing attack anims (even now i set it to null ptr)
getting stuck on perfrom attack because rtoation is never equal to look rot if player is moving 
enemy still moving when attackign even when it should be set to its own pos. 
make it so speical atack cant happen right after nromal  (like special to normal attack cooldown maybe)
player trigger may be too big 
sort out mini enemy transitions
fsm stay in idle for longer before wander 
mini enemy not seeking player when in range 
mini enemy attack cooldown
fsm make area where in player range bigger so they seek more 
mini enemy causing damage without attack anim
when mini enemies spawn main enemy teleports (ignore collision layer needs adding)
change where mini enemies spawn (random)
enemy starts psawning special attacks too often - when ever player attacks its immeditely reactivsitng able to special attack and it never gets set back,neither does attack in the last minute cooldown works normally when no attacks have been perfoemed 
reset last minute stats after every special attack possibly  
bt wait modew still going over max time issue: subtracting deltatime may not work as intended
main enemy spawning rnage attack right after special - dont allow 
get mini enemy out of the floor
fix bounding box again 
fix UI 
special attack collision not stopping them spawning
apply special attack to player and make sure it works right 
cahnge angle to attack
make player special attack look better 
simple distance look sbetter
