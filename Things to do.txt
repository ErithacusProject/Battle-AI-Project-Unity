untested:
make speical attack damage enemy 

most important:
bt needs to attack more maybe 
mini enemies freeze when attacked transition issue 
main enemy moving while doing aTTACKS 
what if htey jsut xplode 

not working:

stretch goals:
death animation 
maybe a way to pick attacks based on TP? (decision tree)
make more attacks
sfx
comment code 
attack needs delaying until x seconds into aniamtion (half of freeze time) call attack anim when wait start instead maybe?
area avoid for mini enemies
