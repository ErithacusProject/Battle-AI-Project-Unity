untested:
last minute stats 
check how offensively the player is playing 

needs coding:
Attack aniamtion
death animation 
fast and slow run (depending on speed)
work on finite state machine enemy
work on finite state machine animation 
maybe a way to pick attacks based on TP?
animation and behaviour tree adjusting 
wait modes going on to often?
face player while in waitmode??
mini enemy needs setting up on creation to have player refs 


done: 
issue: on attacked not calling any fucntions below  (lower attack cooldown or have different ones for range and mellee?)
hp and tp UI (player)
very slow moving down when moving on jump
ui anchoring 
condiiton check if can attack for when in range and then flee if not 
player only regain TP when attack actually hits
enemys allowed to be spawned limit
