untested:
last minute stats 
condition: is health high?
condition: is health low?
check how offensively the player is playing 

needs coding:
Attack aniamtion
fast and slow run (depending on speed)
make new conditions based on AI strategy questionaire 
apply things in the questionaire to behaviour tree and change chances 
work on finite state machine enemy
work on finite state machine animation 
change time limit for wait mode (make it serialze field?)
hp and tp UI (player and AI)
player only regain TP when attack actually hits
maybe a way to pick attacks based on TP?
very slow moving down when Y isnt locked, because fallins it getting set to first frame speed instead of getting faster. need to read current veloctiy and mke changes to that without changing Y
fix overhead UI for enemy
controller controls

done: 
response to being attacked
child rotation issue 
fix pathfinding for range attacks
make it so range attacks can lose tp
make a check distance node 
was attacked not working (or attacks not working?)
sapwn helpers function
