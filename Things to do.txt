untested:
fsm stay in idle for longer before wander 
bt wait modew still going over max time issue: subtracting deltatime may not work as intended
fsm make area where in player range bigger so they seek more 

most important:
lock movement sometimes lasts too long tbh (TIME LIMIT ON IT AND WAIT MODE?)
mini enemy not seeking player when in range 
not looking at player sometimes while doing attack anim
attack needs delaying until x seconds into aniamtion (half of freeze time) call attack anim when wait start instead maybe?
enemy starts psawning special attacks too often (LAST MIN TRAKC NOT WORKING PROPERLY)
main enemy moving while doing attack anims (even now i set it to null ptr)

not working:
when mini enemies spawn main enemy teleports (ignore collision layer needs adding)

stretch goals:
death animation 
maybe a way to pick attacks based on TP? (decision tree)
make more attacks
sfx
comment code 

done: 
fix anim again 
nav to attack fix again and ad on enter function 
floating main enemy
freeze times need adjusting
