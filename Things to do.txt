untested:
fsm stay in idle for longer before wander 
bt wait modew still going over max time issue: subtracting deltatime may not work as intended
fsm make area where in player range bigger so they seek more 
ui number round for hp so it doesnt decimalise

needs coding:
Attack aniamtion
death animation 
maybe a way to pick attacks based on TP? (decision tree)
make more attacks
lock movement sometimes lasts too long tbh (TIME LIMIT ON IT AND WAIT MODE?)
fix the too fast rotataion with toms fix
add sppecial attack back to player 
sfx
comment code 

not working:
when mini enemies spawn main enemy teleports (ignore collision layer needs adding)

done: 
naviagte to attack still not working sometimes??
mini animations
cooldown to wait mode after attakcs or since last waitmode 
player not grounding sometimes and getting stuck in jump 
mini enemy moves while attacking sometimes 
player attack animation cooldown
